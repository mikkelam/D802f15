The fact that a valve can break is modeled by letting the domain of Valve = {open, closed, brokenopen, brokenclosed}

The fact the a broken valve remains in same state is catched by 
P(brokenopen_{t+1} | brokenopen_t) = 1
P(brokenclosed_{t+1} | brokeclosed_t) = 1

Inflow of water and outflow through valve is catched by P(Watertank)_{t+1} because it is conditional dependent on P(Watertank)_t and P(Valve)_t

We have chosen different probabilities for the failure of the valve flow sensor, depending on an actual flow or not.
If there is a flow, it will show flow with probability 0.99. However, if there isn't a flow, it will show noflow with probability 0.95.
Our reason for this difference is because we think a humidity sensor has been used. It is easy to measure humidity when water is flowing,
but when no water is flowing, there might still be some humidity causing false positives.
