\subsection{Notable important weights} % (fold)
\label{sub:important_weights}

While testing various features we found various weights which seem to be very indicative of the outcome of the match. In this section we will list some of them. It is useful to list these, because they imply a good strategy in the game.

Firstly, one should know that no weights were much higher than others, which would imply the game is relatively balanced! If the opposite was the case, certain strategies would be too good. Which probably would result in a rebalance of the game. Also note that weights are mostly symmetric around 0, which implies that the game is symmetric across the two teams, the weights are based on the played match, and the symmetric match might not have been played.

The most notable counter pair features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jinx-BLUE-VS-LeSin-RED: $-0.0119288807981$
    \item Blitzcrank-BLUE-VS-LeSin-RED: $-0.0106350631354$
    \item LeSin-BLUE-VS-Blitzcrank-RED: $0.0136289697347$
\end{itemize}
These weights are negative because we are predicting when the blue team wins, and the matchups shown are bad for the blue team. This means that the champion Jinx is bad vs LeSin, to explain this one can look at their abilities. Jinx is a very squishy, but high damage dealing champion, while LeSin can teleport close to enemies and deal high damage. Blitzcrank vs LeSin and Nidalee, might be bad for Blitzcrank because he can pull enemies close to him and deal damage, but LeSin can quickly jump away from Blitzcrank.

When using rank and single champions as features we get the following important features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bard-RED: $0.0527918687949$
    \item LeSin-RED: $0.0583745797894$
    \item Blitzcrank-BLUE: $0.0662272312767$
    \item BEST-RANK-BLUE:$ 0.145049832434$
\end{itemize}

These weights are positive, so once they are true, it is good for the blue team. This means that once Bard or LeSin is picked for the opposing team, blue has an easier time winning. Blitzcrank when picked for blue is the best single champion to pick. Best rank for blue means that blue has the highest ranked players, which intuitively makes sense that it gives them better chances of winning.
