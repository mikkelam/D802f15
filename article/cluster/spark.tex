\subsection{Spark}\label{sec:spark}
Apache Spark is a general purpose cluster-computing system, that offers a high level programming API as well as a set of high-level tools, for SQL data, machine learning and graph processing~\cite{sparkintro}.

A Spark application is a user-application that is run by the \emph{Driver Program}, seen in \Cref{fig:spark}, in which a \emph{SparkContext} object is defined. The SparkContext can connect to several \emph{Cluster managers}; e.g.\ but not limited to Spark Standalone, Yarn or Mesos. For the purpose of this project, the default standalone manager is sufficient. When connected, the SparkContext gathers the \emph{Executors}, which are running processes on the \emph{Worker nodes}. The worker nodes are also Hadoop data nodes, as to not limit the computation from slow network transfer speeds. Each driver program gets has it's own set of executors which isolate the programs from each others. If programs need to share data, it is done through an external storage system like e.g.\ HDFS.\@

By default the standalone cluster manager handles worker node failure, but as the manager uses a single-node master for work scheduling, the manager has a single-point of failure by default. External services such as Apache ZooKeeper can be used to address this problem, by distributing and coordination the scheduling. For the purpose of this project the cluster is set up much like HDFS.\@ One node acts as a central node, running the driver program and cluster manager, the remaining three nodes are worker nodes. The worker nodes and data nodes are set up on the same machines, as to avoid unnecessary load on the network~\cite{sparkcluster}. The cluster manager interfaces with Hadoop and assign work to be done as close to the data as possible. In the general case, this means that the executors will only access data from the worker nodes own disk. %??-no source for last statement.
