\subsection{Performance of the cluster}\label{sec:benchmark}
Before using the cluster to perform machine learning operations on a large amount of data, a benchmark experiment to show how fast the cluster can do a simple word count. Three different files of the sizes 1GB, 5GB, and 10GB.\@ will be generated for the experiment. They contain unsorted random numbers between $-$2,147,483,646 and 2,147,483,647 which will be treated as strings. The specifications for the cluster was specified in \Cref{sec:clustersetup}, and the details of word count was described in \Cref{sec:mapreduce_programming_model}. The result of the experiment can be seen in \Cref{tab:bench}.
