\begin{abstract}
In this paper a method to predict the outcome of League of Legends games is explored. Such a method can help League of Legends players increase their probability of picking a winning set of champions, or help developers balance elements of the game itself. The method is based on big data and machine learning techniques, where a cluster of 4 machines, and 456GB of data is used to develop classifiers. The data was supplied by Riot Games' public API.\ The cluster consists of a Hadoop Distributed Filesystem and Apache Spark. Through experiments with different supervised learning techniques and different feature sets, the logistic regression classifier was chosen. When combined with Spark and a large dataset, an accuracy of 58.5\% was achieved. Finally we present the knowledge we gained from doing the match prediction problem on a cluster.
