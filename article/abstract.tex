In this paper, a method to help League of Legends players increase their probability of picking a winning set of champions is developed. It is done on a big data set of the size of 456GB which was supplied by, the developers of League of Legends, Riot Games' public API.\@ The data was stored on a cluster of 4 machines, consisting of one master and three worker nodes. All of them running Hadoop Distributed Filesystem and Apache Spark. Through testing, logistic regression was picked as the prediction method, and using it through spark on the big data, we arrived at 58.5\% accuracy.
