In this paper we will explore predicting the outcome of matches played in the online video game League of Legends. The overall goal is to provide strategic knowledge which players can utilise. It is also helpful knowledge for the game devlopers, for balancing of the game itself. Our approach is based on big data and machine learning techniques, where a cluster of 4 machines, and 456GB of data is used to train classifiers. The data was supplied by Riot Games' public API.\ The cluster utilises the distributed systems: Hadoop and Apache Spark. Through experiments with different supervised learning techniques and different sets of features, logistic regression was chosen for big data experiments. Using logistic regression and big data techniques on a large dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 58.5\%. Lastly we present some knowledge which is extracted from results of the experiments performed on the cluster.
