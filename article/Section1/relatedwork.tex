K.\ Conley and D.\ Perry have trained a classifier to predict the winning team of a Dota 2 match~\cite{dota2article}, by only considering the heroes chosen at the beginning of the game. Dota 2 is game very similar to LoL.\@
Each feature used, represents the presence or absence of a particular hero on one of the teams.
When training on 18,000 matches they could correctly predict the outcome of 69.8 \% of the 5,669 matches in their test set.
With 50,000 training samples, they almost reached 70 \% correct predictions. Only matches between high skilled players were considered.

%The method they use can be further improved, since they only tried to capture the strength of each hero individually.
%They did not consider that some combinations of heroes are stronger when fighting together compared to other combinations.
%We believe these synergies are important to consider, which are discussed further in \Cref{sec:choosingfeatures}.

%As of patch 5.3.0.291, LoL included 123 different champions. If we want to take account for synergies between that amount of champions, we might have to train on a huge amount of data, in order to have all combinations of champions represented an adequately number of times in the training samples. We will therefore approach this problem as a big data problem.

Hadoop MapReduce and different variants have successfully been used for big data problems, by distributing the work load between many nodes in a cluster~\cite{ApacheSpark}.
In cases where it is only necessary to read from data, the Apache Spark framework seems to be much faster.
For iterative machine learning jobs, it outperforms MapReduce by a factor of 10.
