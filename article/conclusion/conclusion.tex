\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We solved the big data problem by storing the 456GB of data on a cluster which consists of a master and three worker nodes. The cluster runs with Debian linux distribution as operating system, with Hadoop filesystem as distributed file system and Apache Spark as the data processing engine.

To help players pick a winning combination of champions we trained a model using logistic regression on the cluster. The model was trained on almost 2 million matches using 70\% for training and 30\% as test samples. After running for a long duration, the test sample gave an accuracy of 58.5\%, while tests on the training data gave an accuracy of 58.73\%, which shows that we have no overfitting. We believe that the accuracy shows that LoL is a rather well balanced game that favours the skills of the individual players rather than the power of champion selection. In addition the method of matching players also adds an extra layer of balance as players of roughly the same skill level, will be playing against each other.
