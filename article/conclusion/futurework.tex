\subsection{Future work}\label{sec:futurework}
The next step of this project will be to add additional features, this could be done using feature hashing with generation of random feature combinations. This would create a lot of new features where some might be a better than expected, while others would be completely useless.
If the number of tests increases greatly, increasing the number of worker nodes in the cluster could cut the computation time down. If the cluster grows a lot, then making it more fault tolerant by increasing the number of replications could be a good idea.

The next major step is to consider the information we know about the midgame. This could be used for an agent that from champion selection until the end of the game would give recommendations for decisions to make. These decisions would, be based on events as they are happening in the game. The further development of this agent would be to eventually let it control a champion, essentially playing the game instead of a human. This development would have to involve deep analysis for optimal decision making for all the abilities.
