\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Online multiplayer games have the possibiltiy of generating a lot of data, this only increases with the number of players and possible options for affecting the power of the player or the team. League of Legends, created by Riot games, was the most played online game in the beginning of 2015 \cite{LoLmostplayed}, mustering 27 million people playing it daily, in the beginning of 2014 \cite{LoL27mill}. When playing the game, the players are divided into two teams, each of 5 players, where each player picks 1 champion, from more than 100 different ones, they want to play. As the game advances experience and money is given depending on the performance of the players, the experience is used to improve the skills of the champion while money is spend purchasing items that will help the player or the team. The data Riot games gather from the game is extensive with many parameters \cite{LoLparameters}, which gives it many possible interesting applications. 

This paper will use this data to create a model capable of predicting the winning team based on the composition of champions or even predicting which champion should be chosen to increase the probability of winning, given the enemy teams selection of champions. Since there are so many different champions and purchasable items, the variations of possible options the player can take is large, this means that we will require a great deal of data, more than can be stored optimally in any given database. To handle both the size of the data and the computations, we will require a cluster.
